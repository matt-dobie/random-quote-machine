# Random Quote Machine
This web app was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> intermediate front-end projects. The aim is simply to allow the user to randomly generate famous quotes, both from real people and characters in movies. The clean minimalist layout was created using Bootstrap 4, and the quotes themselves were generated using the <a href="" target="_blank">Random Famous Quotes API</a> and JavaScript.
